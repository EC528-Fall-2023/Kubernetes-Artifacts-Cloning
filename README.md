## 1. Vision and Goals of The Project: 
Our project aims to develop a tool that will help our users migrate Kubernetes artifacts between clusters with zero downtime.

### Goal:
 - **Easy to use**
 - **Seamless clone**
 - **Selective migration** 
 - **Automation**
---
## 2. Users/Personas Of The Project:
 - **Cloud Developers**:
 
   Cloud developers are empowered by this tool to seamlessly migrate deployed artifacts between clusters with varying environment setups. It simplifies the process of replicating applications across different stages of development, testing, and production, ensuring consistency and reducing manual configuration overhead.
 - **Site Reliability Engineers (SREs)**:

   SREs rely on this tool to efficiently duplicate and migrate entire application ecosystems across clusters with diverse configurations. This capability greatly assists in their responsibilities of maintaining application reliability, diagnosing issues, and conducting extensive testing in different environments, ultimately enhancing the overall resilience of the system.

## 3. Scope and Features Of The Project:
 - **Easy to use** With a given source and destination cluster, the command line will trigger the tool for artifact cloning.
 - **Seamless clone** Everything within the artifact should stay unchanged after cloning (like Pod, Service, Ingress, Config Map, Secrets, Volumes, Deployment, and StatefulSet)
 - **Selective migration** With given parameters such as namespaces, labels, and so on, the user can migrate part of the artifact
 - **Automation** The migration should have minimized manual intervention, and the transfer should be automated. With just one command, the transfer is done and safe.
